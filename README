Dart version written by Clement Skau

Converted from the Python port written by Masato Hagiwara, 
which in turn was ported from the original JavaScript version by Taku Kudo.

The original JavaScript version went offline shortly before I started this,
so one extra level of indirection was needed. Sorry.
